Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview:
Predictive Analytics can identify specific risk factors for various populations. For example, it can identify patients with the highest probability of hospitalization. Also, if it is an infectious disease, it can help us prevent a significant crisis. The existing statistics say that data analytics will be crucial soon for the healthcare industry, and it is becoming very very crucial in clinical, operational, and financial sectors.

Disease Prediction plays a pivotal role in healthcare informatics. The symptoms of a patient can identify most diseases. Multiple Diseases can have the same symptoms, so doctors generally suggest lab tests to identify the disease correctly. However, lab tests are costly and time-consuming. If identifying a disease based only on the symptoms is achieved, then appropriate lab tests can be suggested to the patient. This helps identify the disease swiftly, and as a result, treatment can be provided immediately.

Project Aim:
The main aim of this project is to use machine learning methods to predict the top 3 diseases based on symptoms displayed by the patient. The dataset is taken from Kaggle, consisting of 41 unique diseases with 131 symptoms.

Methodology:
We analyzed different and parallel classification systems for disease prediction as it enhances the computational efficiency of results. Feature selection decreases the accuracy of the model; hence all symptoms are considered for modeling. A pdf report is generated with the top 3 diseases, their probabilities, and a short description of the disease.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains 41 unique diseases with 131 symptoms
